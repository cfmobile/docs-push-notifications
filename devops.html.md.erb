## <a id="uninstalling"></a> Uninstalling

**IMPORTANT**

  Push is a stateful service!

  It is advised that you do **NOT UNINSTALL** the Push tile in order to solve problems with binding or communicating with other services. The Push team will
  provide instructions on how to manually restore these connections.

  Deleting the tile will cause all of the Push user data stored in the MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ services to be **DELETED** as well.

  If you need to delete the Push tile or delete any of its connections to the above services then you will need to **BACKUP** and **RESTORE** all of the Push user
  data in these services.

  Instructions for backing up and restore the user data is provided below.

## <a id="env_variables"></a> Configurable Environment Variables

### Push Api

    push_security_trustAllCerts (Boolean, default: inherited from cf runtime)

  When the `push_security_trustAllCerts` environment variable is set to `true` the Push API will skip SSL validation on calls to RabbitMQ and the Push
  Scheduler. This variable is necessary in environments that use self-signed certificates. The default value is `false` unless the CF Runtime is configured to
  trust self-signed certificates.

  _Certificates generated in Elastic Runtime are signed by the Operations Manager Certificate Authority. They are not technically self-signed, but they are
  referred to as 'Self-Signed Certificates' in the Ops Manager GUI and throughout this documentation._

    push_scheduler_sendImmediatelyWithin (Integer, default: 60)

  The `push_scheduler_sendImmediatelyWithin` environment variable pertains to scheduled push notifications. It is a threshold (in seconds) within which the push
  server will skip scheduling a push and simply send it right away. The default value is 60 seconds. If a push is scheduled within 60 seconds of the current time
  it will not be scheduled but simply be sent right away. You can modify that threshold by modifying this environment variable.

    push_apns_sendReceipt (Boolean, default: true)

  The `push_apns_sendReceipt` environment variable is a flag that enables passing a receipt to the device as part of the push payload. The receipt is a unique id
  for each message that can be used for analytics.  This flag enables sending receipts for iOS/APNS.

    push_apns_logDeviceTokens (Boolean, default: true)

  The `push_apns_logDeviceTokens` environment variable controls the log verbosity of the APNS push handler. When set to `true` the device token for every
  recipient of a push will be logged as the push is sent. Note that this extra logging will reduce push throughput.

    push_gcm_sendReceipt (Boolean, default: true)

  The `push_gcm_sendReceipt` environment variable is a flag that enables passing a receipt to the device as part of the push payload. The receipt is a unique id
  for each message that can be used for analytics.  This enables sending receipts for Android/GCM.

    push_gcm_logDeviceTokens (Boolean, default: true)

  The `push_gcm_logDeviceTokens` environment variable controls the log verbosity of the Android push handler. When set to `true` the device token for every
  recipient of a push will be logged as the push is sent. Note that this extra logging will reduce push throughput.

#### Installing the push server behind a proxy (available in v1.3.2+)

  Starting in Push version 1.3.2 you can route communication with push providers (APNS, Google Cloud Messaging) through a proxy server. GCM pushes can use
  either a HTTP or socks proxy. APNS pushes can only use a socks proxy. Use the following environment variables to specify proxies.

    push_gcm_httpProxyHost (String, default: [empty])
    push_gcm_httpProxyPort (Integer, default: [empty])

  The `push_gcm_httpProxyHost` and `push_gcm_httpProxyPort` environment variables allow you to specify an HTTP proxy server through which to route Google API
  requests (for Android pushes).

    push_gcm_socksProxyHost (String, default: [empty])
    push_gcm_socksProxyPort (String, default: [empty])

  The `push_gcm_socksProxyHost` and `push_gcm_socksProxyPort` environment variables allow you to specify a SOCKS proxy through which to route Google API
  requests.

  Note: If both HTTP and SOCKS proxies are defined for GCM, SOCKS will be used.

    push_apns_socksProxyHost (String, default: [empty])
    push_apns_socksProxyPort (String, default: [empty])

  The `push_apns_socksProxyHost` and `push_apns_socksProxyPort` environment variables allow you to specify a SOCKS proxy through which to route APNS push
  requests.

## <a id="backup_and_restore"></a> Backup And Restore

### Backup MySQL data

  It is highly recommended that you enable [ automatic backups ](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/backup.html#automated-backups) with your MySQL Tile (Requires an Amazon s3 Bucket). Additionally, you should always backup 
  your MySQL tile if you are planning on removing Push Notification Service or MySQL. You can perform a manual backup by following the directions found here: [ MySQL Manual Backup ](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/backup.html#manual-process)

  Follow these instructions to backup _solely_ the Push Notification database.

  - In the Apps Manager console in the "system" org go to the "push-notifications" space and the "push-analytics" app.
  - Go to the "Services" tab.
  - Click "&blacktriangleright; Show credentials" for the MySQL service.
  - Get "username", "password" and "database name".
  - SSH into the proxy for your Pivotal CF environment.
  - From the proxy run (using the credentials above):

  		mysqldump -h hostname -p -u username database_name > push_db.sql

### Backup encryption key

   - In the Apps Manager console go to the "push-api" app and go to the "Env Variables" tab.
   - Get and record the value for `crypto_applicationKey`. You will need this key during the installation.
	  - The `crypto_applicationKey` environment variable contains the key which will be used to encrypt sensitive information used by the push server (i.e.:
		iOS push certificates, Google API keys). This value is set at install time and **_should not be modified_**. You will however need to record this value
		in order save and restore the push notification service database.

### Restore MySQL data

  - From the Apps Manager console in the "push notifications" space through the "system" org, stop the "push" and "push-api" applications.
  - Go to "Services".
  - Click "&blacktriangleright; Show credentials" for MySQL.
  - Get "username", "password" and "database name".
  - SSH into the proxy for your Pivotal CF environment.
  - Delete data from Push installation (this should just be empty data) by running the following command from the proxy (using the above credentials):

    		mysql -h hostname -p -u username name -e "drop database database_name; create database database_name;"

  - Import data from old install by running the following command from the proxy (using the above credentials):

  			mysql -h hostname -p -u username database_name < push_db.sql

  - Enable migrations:
	+ In the Apps Manager console, find the "push-api" application and go to the "Env Variables" tab.
	+ Edit `liquibase_runMitgations` and set it to `true`.

  - Start the "push-api" and "push" applications.

  - Disable migrations:
	+ In the Apps Manager console, find the "push-api" application and go to the "Env Variables" tab.
	+ Edit `liquibase_runMigrations` and set it to 'false'.

  - Restart the "push-api" and "push" applications.

### Backup Redis Data

  - See [redis backup instructions ](redis-backup.html)
