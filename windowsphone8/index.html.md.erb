title: Windows Phone 8 Push Client SDK
---

<strong>MPNS is no longer supported in version 1.4+ of PCF Push Notifications.</strong>

#Features#

The [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Mobile Services](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-mobile-services) Push Client SDK is a light-weight library that will help your application register with Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS) and an instance of the PCF Mobile Services Push Notification server.

The SDK does not provide any code for handling remote push notification.

#Device Requirements#

The Push SDK requires WP8 Silverlight.

#Getting Started#

In order to receive push messages from the Push Server in your WP8 application, you will need to follow these steps:

1. If you do not want to be throttled to 500 push notifications per subscription, per day, create a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate on the Windows Dev Center. Follow the instructions here:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/ff941099(v=vs.105).aspx

1. Set up your application, environment, and a variant on the PCF Mobile Services administration console. This task is beyond the scope of this document, but please note you will need the TLS certificate above. After setting up your variant in PCF Mobile Services, make sure to note the Variant UUID and Variant Secret parameters. You will need them below.

1. Add a reference to the SDK NuGet package to your project.
Even if you don't have access to the NuGet, you could simply obtain the compiled DLL files. Please contact the PCF Mobile Services team for help.

1. Enable ID_CAP_PUSH_NOTIFICATION in your WMAppManifest.xml.

1. Add the following lines of code to the initialization section of your application.

    ```csharp
    MSSParameters parameters = new MSSParameters(variant_uuid,variant_secret, base_server_url, server_name, device_alias, tags);
    await MSSPush.SharedInstance.RegisterForPushAsync(parameters);
    ```

The `variant_uuid`, `variant_secret`, and `server_name` are described above. The `base_server_url` parameter is the base url of your push server. The `device_alias` parameter is a custom field that you can use to differentiate this device from others in your own push messaging campaigns; can be null. The `tags` parameter is a custom field that you can use to differentiate registrations in your own push messaging campaigns; can be null.

You should only have to call `RegisterForPushAsync` once in the lifetime of your process - but calling it more times is not harmful. The `RegisterForPushAsync` method is asynchronous and will return before registration is complete. To know when registration is complete (or if it fails) and obtain the `HttpNotificationChannel`, provide an `Action<HttpCompletionArgs>` as the second argument.

The PCF Mobile Services Push SDK takes care of the following tasks for you:

 * Registering with MPNS.
 * Sending your HTTP notification channel URI to the back-end (i.e.: the PCF Mobile Services).
 * Re-registering after the HTTP notification channel URI or any other registration parameters are updated.
