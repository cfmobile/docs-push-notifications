## Specifying a Custom User ID ##

By default, push expects the custom user ID field during a device registration to be specified using 
a JSON Web Token, signed using the application's shared secret.

The application's shared secret can be found on the push dashboard, under the configuration tab.

#### Signed Custom User ID Format

Push API expects the `custom_user_id` to be sent as a signed JSON Web Token (JWT).
This is to validate that the registration request came from a trusted application.

The Token should be signed with HMAC-SHA256, and the content should be as follows:

Header

```JSON
{
  "alg": "HS256"
}
```

Payload

```JSON
{
  "custom_user_id": "<YOUR CUSTOM USER ID>"
}
```

Signature

```
signature = HMAC-SHA256(sharedSecret, unsignedToken)
unsignedToken = encodeBase64(header) + '.' + encodeBase64(payload)
sharedSecret = Application Shared Secret
```

Final Token

```
token=encodeBase64(header) + '.' + encodeBase64(payload) + '.' + encodeBase64(signature)
```

The final token is what should be sent as the value of the `custom_user_id` field in the registration call.

```JSON
{
  ...
  "custom_user_id": token
  ...
}
```

#### Unsigned Custom User ID Format ####

The requirement to sign custom user IDs can be disabled by setting the `push_security_verifyCustomUserId` environment 
variable to false for the push-api servce.

If signed custom user IDs are disabled, then the registration call should just contain the custom user ID as plain text

```JSON
{
  ...
  "custom_user_id": "<YOUR CUSTOM USER ID>"
  ...
}
```
