title: First Push Walkthrough
---

#Step 1
The first step is to integrate the sdk with your app. See the getting started section of the [SDK documentation](../../development-guide.html).

#Step 2
Add an application by filling in the form that appears when first navigating to the dashboard. If applications already exist, you can access the add application screen by clicking on "Create New Application" on the left hand sidebar dropdown.

#Step 3
Fill in fields on the new application screen. There are two fields: name and description. These fields are purely for keeping track of which application is which.

#Step 4
Create a new platform by clicking on the 'Add Platform' button and filling out the proper fields depending on the platform type.

For iOS/Windows Phone, you will need the appropriate certificate for your platform (see the [SDK documentation](../../development-guide.html)).

#Step 5
After saving, click on 'Configuration' on the left sidebar, this is where the UUID and secret will be found. These values are used to register devices and eventually send pushes.
