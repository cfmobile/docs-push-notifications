title: Custom User IDs
---

The Custom User ID feature allows you to register a device under an ID that is
meaningful to your system such as their login. In addition, the same Custom User ID
can be used to refer to multiple devices. This means that a push sent to the
Custom User ID will be sent simultaneously to all devices registered with this Custom User ID.

**Note:** The Custom User ID field is case sensitive for device registrations.


### Custom User ID and Topics

Custom User ID works in combination with topics so that you can target a set of
Custom User IDs as well as topics and the Push Notification Service will ensure that
all devices receive only 1 copy of the notification.
