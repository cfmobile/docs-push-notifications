##v1.8.1
**Release Date: March 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

Fix an issue when upgrading the push tile on PCF 1.9.*

##v1.8.0
**Release Date: February 2017**

**Features**

Ability to customize push app instance counts during deployment. For more information, see [custom deployments](installation.html#DeploymentSettings).

The Push Dashboard will now show a warning when the iOS certificate in use is expired.

Official support for Azure.

**Bug Fixes**

**Known Issues**

Upgrading to Push 1.8.0 when running on PCF 1.9 may fail with an error `Server error, status code: 500, error code: 10001, message: An unknown error occurred.`

This is due to the 1.8 version of the push tile defaulting to 2 app instances for each application it deploys on the system org, push-notifications space. This error is encountered when an app is staged and scaled at the same time.

Please upgrade to version 1.8.1 to fix this issue.

Workaround: Update the instance counts of the apps under the system org, push-notifications space to 2 each before installing Push 1.8.0 (or the custom instance counts if you're using that option.)

##v1.7.1
**Release Date: January 2017**

**Bug Fixes**

Fix the ability to edit scheduled pushes

##v1.7.0
**Release Date: December 2016**

**Features**

**Bug Fixes**

**Known Issues**

##v1.6.3
**Release Date: September 2016**

Updated stemcell to v3263 to address kernel vulnerabilities (includes 4.4 kernel)


##v1.6.2
**Release Date: September 2016**

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Update to Push Notification Service v1.6.2 prior to upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry v1.8.</p>

Updated stemcell to v3263 to address kernel vulnerabilities (includes 4.4 kernel)

Fixes:

- Fixed dashboard issue found when upgrading from PCF v1.7 to PCF v1.8

**Known Issues**

If you installed Push v1.6.2+ after upgrading to PCF v1.8, then remove the app named `push-notifications-analytics` with the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf delete push-notifications-analytics</pre>

##v1.6.1
**Release Date: August 2016**

Features:

- Proxy support in Push Tile: Users can now add a proxy in the Push Tile (via Ops Mgr console)
- Installation logs now available in Ops Mgr console upon installation failure
fixes

Fixes:

- Fixed issue with multiple tenants being provisioned in system org in push notifications space
- Fixed scaling issue with push api instances due to lack of database connections


**Known Issues:**

Upgrading to PCF v1.8 exposes a bug in versions of Push v1.6.1 and older. The impact is that the dashboard won't be able to display analytics (a message will appear stating "Analytics Data is not available at the moment"). Analytics data is still collected on the backend, the bug prevents it from being displayed.

**The recommended solution is to upgrade to push v1.6.2 prior to upgrading to PCF v1.8 (this is now a pre-requisite for PCF v1.8)**

If installing push v1.6.1 or earlier on PCF v1.8, follow the instructions below


1. To confirm this is the problem you are experiencing, you can check to see if there is a CF app running in the `system` org and `push-notifications` space called `push-notifications-analytics`.


2. Replace `push-analytics` with `push-notifications-analytics` and add a matching route as per the commands shown below

 ```
 cf delete push-analytics
 cf rename push-notifications-analytics push-analytics
 cf map-route push-analytics $ENV_URL --hostname push-analytics
 ```

where `$ENV_URL` is the value of the domain name used for your PCF environment
