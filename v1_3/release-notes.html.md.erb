## Upgrading from version 1.2

There is no automated upgrade path from version 1.2 to version 1.3 however it is possible to migrate data from
an 1.2 intallation to a 1.3 installation with the following steps:

###Backup data

  - In the developer console in the "system" org go to the "push-notifications" space and the "push-notifications" app
  - Go to services
  - click show credentials for mysql
  - get username, password and database name
  - ssh into the proxy for your pivotal cf environment
  - From the proxy run 
  	
  		mysqldump -h hostname -p -u username database_name > push_db.sql

###Backup encryption key

   - In the developer console go to the push-notifictions app and go to the "Env Variables" tab
   - Get and record the value for 'crypto_applicationKey'. You will need this during the v1.3 install.

###Backup Redis
  - See [redis backup instructions ](../redis-backup.html) 
    
###Uninstall push 1.2

- Delete Push Notification Service v 1.2.x in Ops Manager

###Install push 1.3

- Upload the pivotal package for Push Notification Service v 1.3.0 to Ops Manager
- Under security settings be sure to enter the encryption key from the previous installation.  This is very important as portions of the exported data is encrypted.
- Apply changes and wait for the install to complete

###Restore data

- From the developer console in the "push notifications" space through the "system" org, stop the "push" and "push-api" applications

#####From the push-api app
- Go to services
- Click show credentials for mysql
- Get username, password and database name
- ssh into the proxy for your pivotal cf environment
- Delete data from push 1.3 install (this should just be empty data)
	- From the proxy run 

    		mysql -h hostname -p -u username name -e "drop database database_name; create database database_name;"

 - Import data from old install
  	- from the proxy run 
  	
  			mysql -h hostname -p -u username database_name > push_db.sql

- Enable migrations
	- In the developer console, find the "push-api" application and go to the "Env Variables" tab 
	- Edit 'liquibase_runMitrations' and set it to 'true'

- Start the "push-api" and "push" applications

- Disable migrations
	- In the developer console, find the "push-api" application and go to the "Env Variables" tab 
	- Edit 'liquibase_runMitrations' and set it to 'false'
	- Restart the "push-api" application

###Bind depricated api url for existing apps (if you are using the old route)

- In the developer console, find the "push-api" application, and go to the Routes tab 
- Click 'Map A Route' add a route named 'push-notifications'
