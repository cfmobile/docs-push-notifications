#Step 2
Select the "Default" service plan. Give the service instance a name and make sure to select the correct Space for the service to be created in before clicking the "Add" button.

#Step 3
You can now click on the "Manage" link for the Push Notifications Service instance you've created. This will open the Push Dashboard.

Add an application by filling in the form that appears when first navigating to the dashboard. If applications already exist, you can access the add application screen by clicking on "Create New Application" on the left hand sidebar dropdown.

#Step 4
Fill in fields on the new application screen. There are two fields: name and description. These fields are purely for keeping track of which application is which.

#Step 5
Create a new platform by clicking on the 'Add Platform' button and filling out the proper fields depending on the platform type.

<p>For Android platforms you will need to provide <strong>Project Number</strong> and <strong>Google Key</strong> values.  The <strong>Project Number</strong> is the numeric value found at the top middle of a project on the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developers Console</a>.  Do not use the 'Project ID’.  The <strong>Google Key</strong> is a Server API key, created on the “Credentials” screen of the Google Developers Console.</p>

<p>For iOS platforms you will need to create a <strong>APNS Development Certificate</strong> and <strong>APNS Production Certificate</strong> using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple Developer Website</a>.  These files, along with their associated private keys, need to be exported from your <strong>Keychain Access</strong> program into a password protected <strong>P12</strong> file.  You will upload this P12 file and provide its password when you create your platform on the PCF Push Notification Service dashboard.</p>

#Step 6
After saving, click on 'Configuration' on the left sidebar, this is where the UUID and secret will be found. These values are used to register devices and eventually send pushes.

#Step 7
Now you will have to integrate the sdk with your app. See the getting started section of the [SDK documentation](../../development-guide.html).

#Step 8
Click on the 'Devices' link on the left sidebar to see registered devices, and click on the 'Test Push' button for the device you wish to send a push.

#Step 10
If the server accepts this push for delivery, a receipt will be shown on screen.  This does not guarantee delivery to the device (device could be off, notifications could be disabled, etc).
